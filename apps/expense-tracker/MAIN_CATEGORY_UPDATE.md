# Main Category Update - No Subcategories for Major Categories

## Overview
Updated the category system so that major standalone categories like Income, Investments, Rent & Housing, and Credit Card Bills are displayed as **main categories only** without showing subcategories when all transactions belong to the main category itself.

## Changes Made

### 1. Category Mapping Updates

#### Income
- **Before**: Category was "Income" but could show various subcategories
- **After**: Maps directly to "Income" main category
- **Display**: Shows only "💰 Income" with transaction count, no subcategories section

#### Investments
- **Before**: Category was "Investment"
- **After**: Maps to "Investments" (standardized name)
- **Display**: Shows only "📈 Investments" with transaction count, no subcategories section

#### Rent & Housing
- **Before**: Category was "Rent"
- **After**: Maps to "Rent & Housing"
- **Display**: Shows only "🏠 Rent & Housing" with transaction count, no subcategories section

#### Credit Card Bills
- **Before**: Category was "Credit Card Bill Payments"
- **After**: Maps to "Credit Card Bills" (shortened)
- **Display**: Shows only "💳 Credit Card Bills" with transaction count, no subcategories section

### 2. Display Logic Enhancement

The UI now intelligently determines whether to show subcategories:

```javascript
// Only show subcategories section if:
// 1. There are subcategories present, AND
// 2. Not just a single subcategory that matches the main category

if (data.subcategories.length > 0 &&
    !(data.subcategories.length === 1 && data.subcategories[0] === mainCat)) {
  // Show subcategories section
}
```

### 3. Subcategory Filtering

When displaying subcategories, the system now filters out the main category name:

```javascript
data.subcategories
  .filter((subcat) => subcat !== mainCat)
  .map((subcat, idx) => (
    // Render subcategory badge
  ))
```

## How It Works

### Example 1: Income Category
If you have 46 transactions all categorized as "Income":
```
💰 Income
46 transactions
[No subcategories section shown]
```

### Example 2: Food & Dining with Multiple Merchants
If you have transactions from Swiggy and Zomato:
```
🍔 Food & Dining
12 transactions

Subcategories / Merchants:
🍽️ Swiggy    🍕 Zomato
```

### Example 3: Mixed Shopping
If you have Amazon and general Shopping:
```
🛍️ Shopping - Online
25 transactions

Subcategories / Merchants:
📦 Amazon
```

### Example 4: Credit Card Bills
All credit card payment transactions:
```
💳 Credit Card Bills
8 transactions
[No subcategories section shown]
```

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner UI**: Major categories don't show redundant subcategory sections
2. **Better UX**: Users immediately see that these are standalone categories
3. **More Intuitive**: Matches user mental model - Rent is Rent, Income is Income
4. **Flexible**: Categories with actual subcategories still show them properly
5. **Consistent**: All category names standardized across the app
