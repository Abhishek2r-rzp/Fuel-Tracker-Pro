# Delete All Transactions Feature

## ✅ Implementation Complete

Added a "Delete All" button to the Transactions page that allows you to delete ALL transactions for your account with proper safety confirmations.

---

## 🔴 How to Delete All Transactions

### **Step 1: Navigate to Transactions Page**
- Open your expense tracker app
- Click on "Transactions" in the sidebar

### **Step 2: Click "Delete All" Button**
- Located in the top-right corner of the page
- Shows count: "Delete All (370)" for example
- Red destructive button to indicate danger

### **Step 3: Confirm Deletion**
- A prompt will appear asking you to type: **"DELETE ALL"** (in capital letters)
- This extra confirmation prevents accidental deletions
- Type exactly: `DELETE ALL`
- Click OK

### **Step 4: Transactions Deleted**
- All your transactions will be deleted from Firestore
- You'll see a success message: "✅ Successfully deleted X transactions!"
- The page will refresh showing no transactions

---

## 🛡️ Safety Features

### **1. Double Confirmation**
```javascript
window.prompt(
  `⚠️ DANGER: This will delete ALL ${transactions.length} transactions!
  
  This action CANNOT be undone!
  
  Type "DELETE ALL" (in capital letters) to confirm:`
);
```

**You MUST type "DELETE ALL" exactly** - prevents accidental clicks

### **2. Visual Warning**
- Red "Delete All" button (destructive variant)
- Shows transaction count in button
- Only appears when transactions exist

### **3. User-Scoped**
```javascript
export async function deleteAllTransactions(userId) {
  // Only deletes transactions for the logged-in user
  const q = query(
    collection(db, COLLECTIONS.TRANSACTIONS),
    where('userId', '==', userId)
  );
  // ...
}
```

**Only YOUR transactions are deleted** - not other users' data

---

## 🎯 What Gets Deleted

### **Deleted:**
✅ All transaction records for your account
✅ Transaction data in Firestore
✅ Local state cleared immediately

### **NOT Deleted:**
❌ Statement records (preserved)
❌ Other users' transactions
❌ Your account information
❌ App settings

---

## 💻 Technical Implementation

### **Service Function:**

Location: `src/services/firestoreService.js`

```javascript
export async function deleteAllTransactions(userId) {
  try {
    // Query all transactions for user
    const q = query(
      collection(db, COLLECTIONS.TRANSACTIONS),
      where('userId', '==', userId)
    );
    
    const querySnapshot = await getDocs(q);
    const transactionIds = querySnapshot.docs.map((doc) => doc.id);
    
    if (transactionIds.length === 0) {
      return 0;
    }
    
    // Delete all in parallel
    const deletePromises = transactionIds.map((id) =>
      deleteDoc(doc(db, COLLECTIONS.TRANSACTIONS, id))
    );
    
    await Promise.all(deletePromises);
    return transactionIds.length;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error deleting all transactions:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### **UI Handler:**

Location: `src/pages/Transactions.jsx`

```javascript
const handleDeleteAll = async () => {
  // Require exact text match
  const confirmed = window.prompt(
    `⚠️ DANGER: This will delete ALL ${transactions.length} transactions!\n\nThis action CANNOT be undone!\n\nType "DELETE ALL" (in capital letters) to confirm:`
  );
  
  if (confirmed !== "DELETE ALL") {
    if (confirmed !== null) {
      alert("❌ Deletion cancelled. Transactions are safe.");
    }
    return;
  }

  try {
    const deletedCount = await deleteAllTransactions(currentUser.uid);
    setTransactions([]);
    setSelectedTransactions([]);
    setCurrentPage(1);
    alert(`✅ Successfully deleted ${deletedCount} transactions!`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error deleting all transactions:", error);
    alert("❌ Failed to delete transactions. Please try again.");
  }
};
```

### **UI Button:**

```jsx
{transactions.length > 0 && (
  <Button
    variant="destructive"
    onClick={handleDeleteAll}
    className="flex items-center gap-2"
  >
    <Trash2 className="w-4 h-4" />
    Delete All ({transactions.length})
  </Button>
)}
```

## ⚠️ Important Warnings

### **This Action is IRREVERSIBLE**
- Once deleted, transactions cannot be recovered
- No "Undo" button
- No backup created automatically
- Data is permanently removed from Firestore

### **When to Use:**
✅ Testing/development - clearing test data
✅ Starting fresh - want to re-import all statements
✅ Privacy - removing all financial data

### **When NOT to Use:**
❌ Just want to delete a few transactions (use bulk select instead)
❌ Not sure if you need the data later
❌ Haven't backed up important information

---

## 🔄 Alternative: Bulk Delete

If you don't want to delete EVERYTHING, use the **Bulk Delete** feature instead:

1. Check boxes next to transactions you want to delete
2. Click "Delete Selected" button
3. Confirm deletion
4. Only selected transactions deleted

**Much safer for targeted deletions!**
