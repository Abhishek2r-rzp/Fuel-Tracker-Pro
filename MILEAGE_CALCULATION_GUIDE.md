# 📊 Mileage & Cost Calculation Guide

## ❓ Why is Avg Mileage showing 0?

**You need at least 2 fuel records to calculate mileage!**

---

## 🧮 How Mileage is Calculated

### Formula:
```
Mileage (km/l) = Distance Traveled ÷ Fuel Consumed
```

### Example:
```
Record 1: Odometer = 3920 km, Fuel = 11.9 L
Record 2: Odometer = 3800 km, Fuel = 10.0 L (previous fill-up)

Distance = 3920 - 3800 = 120 km
Mileage = 120 km ÷ 11.9 L = 10.08 km/l
```

---

## 💰 How Cost per km is Calculated

### Formula:
```
Cost per km (₹/km) = Total Amount ÷ Distance Traveled
```

### Example:
```
Record 1: Amount = ₹1266.28, Distance = 120 km
Cost per km = ₹1266.28 ÷ 120 = ₹10.55/km
```

---

## 📋 What You Need

### Minimum Requirements:
1. ✅ **2 or more fuel records**
2. ✅ **Different odometer readings** for each record
3. ✅ **Records sorted by date** (newest first)

---

## 🎯 Your Current Situation

Looking at your dashboard:
```
Records: 2 (Sep 21, 2025 - both same date & odometer)
Odometer: 3920 km (both records)
Problem: Same odometer = 0 distance = No mileage!
```

### Why Avg Mileage = 0:
- Both records have **same odometer reading** (3920 km)
- Distance = 3920 - 3920 = **0 km**
- Mileage = 0 ÷ 11.9 = **0 km/l**

## ✅ How to Fix (Delete Duplicate)

### **Option 1: Delete from Dashboard**

1. **Go to Dashboard**
2. **Scroll to "Recent Fuel Records" table**
3. **Click "Delete"** button on one of the duplicate records
4. **Confirm deletion**
5. ✅ Duplicate removed!

### **Option 2: Delete from History Page**

1. **Go to "History"** page
2. **Find duplicate record**
3. **Click trash icon** (🗑️)
4. **Confirm deletion**
5. ✅ Duplicate removed!

---

## 📊 After Deleting Duplicate

You'll have:
```
✅ 1 record: Sep 21, 2025 - 3920 km
```

### To See Mileage:
**Add another fuel fill-up** with a different odometer reading!

Example:
```
Current: 3920 km
Next fill-up: 4050 km (after driving 130 km)
→ Mileage will calculate: 130 km ÷ 11.9 L = 10.92 km/l ✅
```

## 🚗 Real-World Example

### Fuel Record Timeline:

**Record 1 (Oldest):**
- Date: Sep 15, 2025
- Odometer: 3800 km
- Fuel: 10.0 L
- Amount: ₹1,000

**Record 2 (Latest):**
- Date: Sep 21, 2025
- Odometer: 3920 km
- Fuel: 11.9 L
- Amount: ₹1,266.28

### Calculations:

**Distance:**
```
3920 km - 3800 km = 120 km
```

**Mileage:**
```
120 km ÷ 11.9 L = 10.08 km/l
```

**Cost per km:**
```
₹1,266.28 ÷ 120 km = ₹10.55/km
```

### Dashboard Shows:
```
Avg Mileage: 10.08 km/l ✅
Cost per km: ₹10.55 ✅
Total Spent: ₹2,266.28
Total Fuel: 21.9 L
```

4. ✅ Regular intervals (weekly/biweekly)

### **For Better Tracking:**
1. ✅ Scan every fuel bill
2. ✅ Check odometer carefully
3. ✅ Delete mistakes immediately
4. ✅ Compare with manufacturer's claimed mileage

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### **"Mileage shows weird number (100+ km/l)"**
- Wrong odometer reading entered
- Delete and re-add with correct reading

### **"Mileage shows negative"**
- Records not sorted by date
- Or odometer reading decreased (typo)
- Check and fix odometer values

### **"Cost per km is very high"**
- Check if you filled a large amount
- Or shorter distance traveled
- Normal if you filled after long stop
