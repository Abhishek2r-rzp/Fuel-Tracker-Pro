## üö® FIXING: CORS Error on Image Upload

You're getting this error:
```
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/...' 
from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy
```

This happens because **Firebase Storage security rules are not configured**.

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION: Deploy Storage Rules

### Option 1: Deploy via Firebase Console (Easiest) ‚≠ê

1. **Open Firebase Console:**
   - Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com
   - Select your project: `fuel-tracker-pro-e11be`

2. **Navigate to Storage:**
   - Click "Build" ‚Üí "Storage" in left sidebar
   - Click on "Rules" tab at the top

3. **Copy & Paste Rules:**
   - Delete existing rules
   - Copy the content from `storage.rules` file
   - Paste into the editor

4. **Publish Rules:**
   - Click "Publish" button
   - Wait for confirmation (takes a few seconds)

5. **Test:**
   - Go back to your app
   - Try uploading a bill image
   - Should work now! ‚úÖ

### Option 2: Deploy via Firebase CLI (Advanced)

If you have Firebase CLI installed:

```bash
# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Initialize Firebase (if not done)
firebase init storage

# Deploy storage rules
firebase deploy --only storage
```

## üìã Storage Rules Explained

The `storage.rules` file contains:

### 1. **Authentication Check**
```javascript
function isAuthenticated() {
  return request.auth != null;
}
```
Only authenticated users can access storage.

### 2. **Image Type Validation**
```javascript
function isImage() {
  return request.resource.contentType.matches('image/.*');
}
```
Only image files are allowed.

### 3. **Size Limit**
```javascript
function isValidSize() {
  return request.resource.size < 10 * 1024 * 1024;
}
```
Max file size: 10MB (though your app compresses to 500KB).

### 4. **User-Specific Access**
```javascript
match /billImages/{userId}/{imageId} {
  allow read: if isAuthenticated() && request.auth.uid == userId;
  allow create: if isAuthenticated() && request.auth.uid == userId;
  allow delete: if isAuthenticated() && request.auth.uid == userId;
}
```
Users can only access their own images in `billImages/{userId}/`.

## üîç Verification

After deploying rules, check:

### 1. **Firebase Console:**
   - Go to Storage ‚Üí Rules
   - Should show your new rules
   - Status should be "Active"

   ```bash
   # In your app
   npm run dev
   ```
   - Login
   - Go to "Scan Bill" or "Add Manual"
   - Upload an image
   - Should upload successfully ‚úÖ

### 3. **Console Logs:**
   - Browser console should show:
     ```
     Compressed image size: 0.XX MB
     Image uploaded successfully: https://...
     ‚úÖ Fuel record saved successfully!
     ```

## üìä Storage Structure

After setup, your Firebase Storage will look like:

```
firebase-storage-bucket/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ billImages/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user1-uid/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user1-uid_timestamp1_random1.jpg
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user1-uid_timestamp2_random2.jpg
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user2-uid/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user2-uid_timestamp1_random1.jpg
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

Each user has their own folder, and images are named:
```
{userId}_{timestamp}_{randomId}.jpg
```
