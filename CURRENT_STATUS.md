## 🔧 Development Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev              # Run all apps
npm run build            # Build all packages
npm run lint             # Lint all packages
npm run clean            # Clean build outputs

# Individual apps
cd apps/expense-tracker
npm run dev              # Run expense tracker only
npm run build            # Build expense tracker only

# Testing
npm run preview          # Preview production build
```

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **Large bundle warning (expense-tracker):** PDF.js library is large (~880KB). Will optimize with dynamic imports in Phase 10.
2. **No tests yet:** Testing framework to be added if needed.

---

## 💡 Tips

1. **Use Turborepo cache:** Only changed packages rebuild
2. **Hot reload:** All apps support HMR
3. **Shared packages:** Changes reflect instantly across apps
4. **Pre-commit hooks:** Build runs automatically before commits
