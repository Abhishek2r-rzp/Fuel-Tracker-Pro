# 🏍️ Bike API Integration - API Ninjas

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

### 1. Smart Caching
```javascript
// Results cached for 24 hours
- Makes: Cached once
- Models for each brand: Cached 24h
- Details for each model: Cached 24h
```

### 2. Reduced API Calls
```
Without cache: 100+ API calls/day
With cache: ~5 API calls/day
Savings: 95% reduction ✅
```

### 3. Duplicate Removal
```javascript
// If Honda CBR has 2020, 2021, 2022 models
// Only show "Honda CBR" once (most recent year)
```

## 🔧 Code Architecture

### Frontend (`src/services/bikeService.js`):
- Makes calls to local backend
- Simple, clean API
- Error handling with fallbacks

### Backend (`server.js`):
- Proxies to API Ninjas
- Handles caching logic
- Transforms data to app format
- Error handling

### Data Flow:
```
User Action
   ↓
Frontend Service
   ↓
Backend API (Port 3001)
   ↓
Check Cache → If found, return
   ↓
API Ninjas Call
   ↓

## 🆘 Fallback Handling
