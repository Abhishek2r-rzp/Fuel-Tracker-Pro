# 🔄 Flexible Schema Design

## Philosophy

**"Extract what you can find, save what you get"**

Different fuel stations use different bill formats. Our OCR system is designed to be **adaptive and forgiving** - it extracts whatever data is available without enforcing a strict schema.

---

## 🎯 Key Principles

### 1. **No Strict Schema Enforcement**
- ✅ Extract any field that can be found
- ✅ Save only fields that have values
- ❌ Don't fail if fields are missing
- ❌ Don't enforce fixed field structure

### 2. **Dynamic Data Structure**
```javascript
// Traditional (Strict) - BAD ❌
{
  date: required,
  amount: required,
  fuelVolume: required,
  stationName: required,  // Fails if not found!
  pumpNumber: required    // Fails if not found!
}

// Flexible (Our Approach) - GOOD ✅
{
  date: "2025-10-04",           // Found ✓
  amount: "1050.00",            // Found ✓
  fuelVolume: "10.5",           // Found ✓
  stationName: "Indian Oil",    // Found ✓
  // pumpNumber not in result because it wasn't found
  // invoiceNumber not in result because it wasn't found
  rawText: "..."                // Always saved for reference
}
```

### 3. **Multiple Pattern Matching**
Each field has **multiple extraction patterns** to handle variations:

```javascript
// Amount extraction - 3 different patterns
patterns = [
  /Total:\s*₹\s*(\d+)/,           // "Total: ₹ 1050"
  /Amount\s*Rs\.\s*(\d+)/,        // "Amount Rs. 1050"
  /(\d+\.\d{2})\s*Rupees/         // "1050.00 Rupees"
]
```

---

## 📊 Field Extraction Strategy

### Critical Fields (Required for Analytics)
These are the **minimum needed** for useful tracking:
1. ✅ **Date** - When did the fuel-up happen?
2. ✅ **Amount** - How much did it cost?
3. ✅ **Fuel Volume** - How much fuel was added?
4. ✅ **Odometer Reading** - Current mileage (for calculating efficiency)

**If any critical field is missing** → User is prompted to fill it in

### Optional Fields (Extract If Available)
Everything else is a **bonus**:
- Station name, address
- Invoice number, pump number
- Fuel type, price per liter
- Tax, discount, payment method
- Vehicle number, attendant name
- etc.

**If optional field is missing** → No problem, just skip it

## 🔍 Smart Pattern Recognition

### Example: Amount Extraction

**Multiple formats supported:**
```
✅ "Total Amount: Rs. 1050.00"
✅ "Net Total Rs 1050"
✅ "Grand Total: ₹1050"
✅ "Amount 1050.00 INR"
✅ "Bill Amount: 1050"
✅ "Rs. 1050 Total"
✅ "1050.00 Rupees"
```

**Implementation:**
```javascript
const amountPatterns = [
  /(?:Total|Amount|Grand\s*Total|Net\s*Amount)\s*:?\s*(?:Rs\.?|₹)?\s*(\d+(?:\.\d{1,2})?)/i,
  /(?:Rs\.?|₹)\s*(\d+(?:\.\d{1,2})?)\s*(?:Total|Amount)/i,
  /(\d+\.\d{2})\s*(?:Rs|INR|Rupees)/i
];

// Try each pattern until one matches
for (const pattern of amountPatterns) {
  const match = line.match(pattern);
  if (match) {
    result.amount = match[1];
    break;
  }
}
```

### Example: Volume Extraction

**Multiple formats supported:**
```
✅ "Quantity: 10.50 Litres"
✅ "10.5 L"
✅ "Volume 10.50 Ltr"
✅ "Sale: 10.5 Liters"
✅ "Qty: 10.50L"
✅ "10.500 Litres"
```

## 🧠 Smart Inference

### Auto-calculation When Possible

**Scenario 1: Missing Price Per Liter**
```javascript
// Extracted from bill
amount = 1050.00
fuelVolume = 10.5
pricePerLiter = ? // Not on bill

// Calculate it!
pricePerLiter = amount / fuelVolume = 100.00
```

**Scenario 2: Missing Total Amount**
```javascript
// Extracted from bill
pricePerLiter = 100.00
fuelVolume = 10.5
amount = ? // Not on bill

// Calculate it!
amount = pricePerLiter * fuelVolume = 1050.00
```

## 📝 Database Storage - Dynamic Schema

### Firestore Document Example

**Complete Extraction:**
```javascript
{
  userId: "user123",
  date: "2025-10-04T14:30:00",
  amount: 1050.00,
  fuelVolume: 10.5,
  odometerReading: 15234,
  fuelType: "Petrol",
  stationName: "Indian Oil Corporation",
  stationAddress: "MG Road, Bangalore",
  invoiceNumber: "INV-2025-12345",
  pumpNumber: "03",
  pricePerLiter: 100.00,
  paymentMethod: "UPI",
  taxAmount: 157.50,
  rawText: "...full bill text...",
  createdAt: "2025-10-04T14:35:00Z"
}
```

**Partial Extraction:**
```javascript
{
  userId: "user123",
  date: "2025-10-04T14:30:00",
  amount: 1050.00,
  fuelVolume: 10.5,
  odometerReading: 15234,  // User entered
  fuelType: "Petrol",
  pricePerLiter: 100.00,    // Auto-calculated
  rawText: "...full bill text...",
  createdAt: "2025-10-04T14:35:00Z"
  // No stationName, no invoiceNumber - that's OK!
}
```

**Minimal Extraction (Manual Entry):**
```javascript
{
  userId: "user123",
  date: "2025-10-04",
  amount: 1050.00,
  fuelVolume: 10.5,
  odometerReading: 15234,
  fuelType: "Petrol",
  createdAt: "2025-10-04T14:35:00Z"
  // Only critical fields - still valid!
}
```

## 🚀 Benefits of Flexible Schema

### 1. **Works with ANY Bill Format**
- Indian Oil format ✅
- Bharat Petroleum format ✅
- Shell format ✅
- Local petrol pump format ✅
- Handwritten bills ✅ (if OCR can read)

### 2. **Graceful Degradation**
```
Perfect extraction (100%) → Auto-save ✨
Good extraction (75%) → Fill 1-2 fields
Partial extraction (50%) → Fill 3-4 fields
Poor extraction (25%) → Manual entry
```

### 3. **Future-Proof**
- New field? Just add extraction pattern
- Different format? Add alternative pattern
- No breaking changes to existing data

### 4. **Better Data Over Time**
- Stores raw text → Can re-process later with better algorithms
- ML/AI improvements → Re-extract from rawText
- User corrections → Learn patterns

## 📈 Real-World Example

### Bill Format: Indian Oil

```
INDIAN OIL CORPORATION
MG Road, Bangalore - 560001
Date: 04/10/2025  Time: 14:30
Invoice: INV-2025-10-12345
Pump No: 03

Product: MS (PETROL)
Quantity: 10.500 Litres
Rate: Rs. 100.00 per Ltr
Amount: Rs. 1050.00

Odometer: 15,234 KM
Payment: UPI - PhonePe
Attendant: Rajesh Kumar

Thank You!
```

**Extracted Data:**
```javascript
{
  stationName: "INDIAN OIL CORPORATION",
  stationAddress: "MG Road, Bangalore - 560001",
  date: "2025-10-04",
  time: "14:30",
  invoiceNumber: "INV-2025-10-12345",
  pumpNumber: "03",
  fuelType: "Petrol",
  fuelVolume: "10.500",
  pricePerLiter: "100.00",
  amount: "1050.00",
  odometerReading: "15234",
  paymentMethod: "UPI",
  attendantName: "Rajesh Kumar",
  rawText: "...full text..."
}
```

**Result:** ✅ **Auto-saved** (all critical fields present)

### Bill Format: Local Pump (Minimal)

```
HP Petrol
04-10-25

Petrol: 12 L
Total: 1200

Thank you
```

**Extracted Data:**
```javascript
{
  stationName: "HP Petrol",
  date: "2025-10-04",
  fuelType: "Petrol",
  fuelVolume: "12",
  amount: "1200",
  pricePerLiter: "100.00",  // Calculated!
  rawText: "...full text..."
}
```

**Result:** ⚠️ **Needs odometer** → User fills one field
