## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. User Scans Bill
```
User takes photo → Image captured
```

### 2. Browser Processes OCR
```javascript
// Tesseract.js runs in browser
const worker = await createWorker('eng');
const { data: { text } } = await worker.recognize(imageUrl);
await worker.terminate();
```

### 3. Extract Data
```javascript
// Smart parsing extracts:
✅ Date
✅ Time
✅ Amount
✅ Fuel Volume
✅ Price per Liter
✅ Fuel Type
✅ Station Name
```

### 4. Auto-fill Form
```
Extracted data → Form fields populated → User verifies → Save!
```

- Ensure good internet (for first load of language data)

### Poor accuracy
- Retake photo in better lighting
- Ensure bill is flat and in focus
- Try cleaning camera lens
- Manual entry always available as fallback

### Worker fails to load
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure internet connection (first time only)
- Clear browser cache and reload
